Description: Pepi is a package that implements a statistical model for studying epigenetic dynamics from genomics data and cell counts.
  The first application deals with the study of a latent branching process augmented with genetic mutations that are accumulated 
  at every division with constant mutation rate, independently of the epigenetic state, and measured by bulk whole-genome DNA 
  sequencing (a common NGS technology).We consider a simple experimental design where cells are sorted (i.e., separated) based on their epimutation state (+ versus −) prior 
  to sequencing, and Variant Allele Frequencies (VAFs) are generated from two samples. 
  With two samples, the VAFs spectrum is bi-variate as any mutation is identified by two coordinates in VAF space. 
  Our intuition is to associate to a VAF spectrum a tree where branches and nodes have an interpretation in terms of 
  epigenetic dynamics: a branch is a trajectory of a cycling cell which goes through a certain number of divisions, 
  and the length of the edge corresponds to the cumulative number mutations arrived on the genome. 
  Tree leaves correspond to most recent common ancestors (MRCAs) of subpopulations of cells in our sample, 
  sorted by the marker state, and each clade of cells forms a cluster in VAF space. For every node two outgoing branches correspond to epi-positive and epi-negative cells and the stochastic 
  tree-generation process starting from a collection of mutations is a hierarchical stick-breaking process. 
  This approach allows for trees of unbounded width and depth, where data can live at any node as in infinite 
  mixtures with a latent dependency structure.The second application deals with the analysis of a time series of cell counts. We consider a longitudinal 
  experiment where cells are sorted based on their epimutation state and counted at different times.
  We implemented a non-linear Bayesian regression model where mean and variance of the number of cells at different
  time points are obtained by solving an ordinary differential equation describing the growth and 
  switching dynamics of the two populations. Inferring the latent parameters driving the branching process,
  we can predict cell counts at arbitrary time points.
